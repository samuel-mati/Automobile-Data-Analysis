# Automobile Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to perform a comprehensive data analysis on a used car dealership's inventory to optimize its pricing strategy and understand factors that impact car sales and fuel efficiency. By analyzing various features of the cars in the inventory, this project provides insights into popular car features, pricing trends, and fuel efficiency, helping the dealership make informed decisions regarding its inventory.

## Objectives

1. **Identifying Popular Car Features & Trends**
   - Determine the most common car makes and body types in the inventory.
   - Analyze top-selling fuel types and body styles.
   - Explore the relationship between drive wheels and car types to identify popular combinations.

2. **Pricing Analysis Based on Car Features**
   - Investigate how the price varies with different attributes like horsepower, curb weight, and body type.
   - Identify correlations between the car's engine type, number of cylinders, and price.
   - Examine the effect of compression ratio on the car's price.

3. **Fuel Efficiency Analysis**
   - Calculate average city and highway mileage for different fuel types.
   - Identify cars with the best fuel efficiency (high city and highway mpg) and compare their prices.
   - Analyze the impact of engine location (front or rear) on fuel efficiency.

## Key Findings

- The analysis revealed that certain car makes and body styles are significantly more popular in the inventory.
- Pricing trends indicated that cars with higher horsepower and curb weight tend to be priced higher.
- The relationship between engine type and price showed that specific engine types (e.g., OHCV) attracted higher pricing, while the number of cylinders did not show a consistent correlation.
- Fuel efficiency analyses provided valuable insights, such as the average mileage for different fuel types and identifying the most fuel-efficient cars.

## Technologies Used

- SQL for data analysis
- Git for version control
- GitHub for repository management

## Getting Started

To run the analysis, clone this repository and access the SQL queries in the `automobile_data_analysis.sql` file. You will need a database management system that supports SQL to execute the queries and analyze the data.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a valuable resource for the used car dealership to enhance its inventory management and pricing strategy. The findings will enable the dealership to make data-driven decisions, ultimately leading to increased sales and customer satisfaction.
